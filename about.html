    About Rabbit
    </h1>
<p>
    Rabbits are small mammals belonging to the Leporidae family and are found on all continents except Antarctica. There are 29 species of rabbits, with the European rabbit being the most common domesticated breed. They are known for their long ears, short tails, and social behavior, often living in groups within warrensâ€”a series of tunnels they dig underground. Rabbits are herbivores, primarily feeding on grass, vegetables, and fruits, and they have a unique digestive system that requires them to eat their own feces to absorb nutrients effectively.
